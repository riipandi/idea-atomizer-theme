# Atomizer

A detailed and accurate Atom One Dark theme for IntelliJ IDEA.

## Motivation

I've always loved the UI and UX of Atom, but prefer the speed and reliability of VS Code.
After looking for a while, I couldn't find any VS Code theme that accurately replicated 
Atom One Dark's interface and syntax highlighting, so I made this one.

## Credits
Thanks to Emmanuel Roussel for creating [Atomize VSCode Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emroussel.atomize-atom-one-dark-theme).
This theme is heavily inspired from Atom's [One Dark Syntax theme](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax).
